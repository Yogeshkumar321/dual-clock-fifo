# dual-clock-fifo
ðŸ”„ Asynchronous FIFO for Clock Domain Crossing (CDC) This project implements a dual-clock FIFO in Verilog to safely transfer data between two asynchronous clock domains using Gray-coded pointers and 2-stage synchronizers. Features include full/empty flag logic, parameterizable depth and width, and a testbench simulating independent write/read clocks for robust verification.
